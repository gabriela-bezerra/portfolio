      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        I live in Seattle and I'm transitioning into software engineering after working
        in HR and Business Administration for over a decade. I’ve always been curious
        about technology, but growing up I had little exposure and was told it was a “boy thing.”
      </p>

      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        In 2019, I moved from Brazil seeking new opportunities and horizons beyond HR.
        After taking a coding fundamentals class, I realized how much I genuinely enjoyed it —
        more than I ever imagined. Now I’m diving deep into building and learning, one project at a time.
